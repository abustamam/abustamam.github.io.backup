  <div class="entry-content"><p>The truth: “Experiment with everything.” </p>

<p>Many restaurants have dozens upon dozens of types of delicious foods. Many “regulars” of these restaurants order the “usual” because they are afraid of trying something new. I challenge you to be the person who tries a new dish, just to try it–because hey, you may find yourself a new “usual!”</p>

<p>Just like patrons of a restaurant, writers too have a “usual.” Of course, there is nothing wrong with having a “usual” genre–“Harry Potter” is proof that 7 books based on the same character can be pretty successful. If it ain’t broke, why fix it? But maybe it is broke, and you may not realize it. I never realized that I needed new glasses until I did get new glasses–then I realized how blind I had been, and how much clearer the world was supposed to be. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“There is no such thing as a stupid idea.” What a truth this is! </p>

<p>Every day, aspiring writers give up their goal to become published because they feel like their ideas are stupid. </p>

<p>Here are a few “stupid” ideas that the authors decided to write about anyway. Let’s see how they turned out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A story about a hot vampire, a hot werewolf, and a girl who doesn’t know which hot guy to go with (Twilight, best-selling book of 2008)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fan fiction extension of the above story, except with less vampires and werewolves and more whips and chains and pain (50 Shades of Gray, sold over 100 million copies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this 10 year old boy discovers he is a wizard, he manages to save the school (and sometimes the world) from the darkest evil ever known to the world, conveniently just before the end of the school year! (Harry Potter, upwards of 400 million copies sold)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Armed with a bow and arrow and two hot guys, this young girl leads the rebellion against the nation that nuked the hell out of the last people who tried to rebel (Hunger Games, 65 million copies sold)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A dude is hired to change a CEO’s mind by hacking into his dreams, but upon failing, the same CEO hires the same dude to change a different CEO’s son’s mind by hacking into his dreams’ dreams (Inception, $800 million gross revenue)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A half-paralyzed guy on an alien planet manages to accomplish insane feats of finesse and agility in 3 months, simply by controlling an alien body. Oh and 3D! (Avatar, first film to gross over $2 billion)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A boat full of hot people sinks (Titanic, $1.85 billion, first movie to surpass $1 billion revenue)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, anything can be twisted to seem like a stupid idea. Since we are our own worst critics, of course we are going to see our ideas as stupid. Moreover, we’re going to compare our ideas with the great ideas we see on Hollywood and on the New York Times best selling books list. </p>

<p>The fact is, everything begins as a stupid idea.  You can flesh that little idea out into something truly meaningful. </p>

<p>The ideas you think of are your ideas. Granted, there are some bad ideas–curling your hair while showering is certainly not a good idea. However, if you can give meaning to an idea, there’s no possible way it could be stupid. For myself, redemption is an important theme. Therefore, anything that involves redemption, no matter how ridiculous it may seem at first, can be meaningful to me. A story could be about two cats feuding, then one redeeming himself by performing a heroic act–perhaps with the right twist, that idea could become something amazing. </p>

<p>Some people may think that “stupid ideas” get in the way of their writing and therefore they stop.</p>

<p>I contend that if you are one of those people, it is you who is in the way of your writing. Get out of your own way and allow the ideas to flow. I hope you never get in the way between a “bad idea” and your writing. You owe it to yourself to acknowledge those ideas. </p>

<time datetime="2014-10-05T23:59:26-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 5<sup>th</sup>, 2014</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“You are what you write.”</p>

<p>There’s an interesting story behind these five words. I once aspired to become a famous Internet blogger, and thus I blogged every day for 30 days to set a habit. I followed the rule, “quantity vs quality.” </p>

<p>Sometimes, quantity trumps quality, especially when it comes to Internet marketing. A blog posted only in one place has only one chance to be viewed. However, syndicating multiple blog posts to multiple websites increases the chances of your name getting out there. For many Internet marketers, writing blogs is simply a means to the end–which is to make sales. Quality wasn’t necessarily important as long as it wasn’t <em>terrible</em>. </p>

<p>That being said, it was extremely difficult for me to blog every day. I never knew what to write about. I wasn’t <em>that</em> interested in my niche. So I sacrificed quality for quantity. </p>

<p>After two weeks of grueling pain through writing uninspired pieces, I reread a few of my blog posts (many of which were written with very little sleep) and thought to myself, “If I didn’t know Rasheed, and I read this blog post, would I think he’s a cool guy?”</p>

<p>The answer was “no.” My blog posts were written with an ulterior motive–to sell. Many were written for the sole purpose of having something to attach my signature to, which of course always included an affiliate link.</p>

<p>Now, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with writing to sell. Products must be sold, and writers are required in order to create sales copy. Sales pages are extremely profitable, even if they are terrible. But there’s a difference between writing to sell and writing to share ideas. When you’re writing to sell, you often put aside the eloquence you would otherwise have if you were writing merely to express ideas. After all, eloquence doesn’t necessarily solve people’s problems–potential customers want to know what the product can do for them. Eloquence rarely has a place in a sales letter, and that’s fine. Right tool for the right job. But if you’re writing to express ideas, then the quality of your writing needs to reflect the ideas you wish to convey. If you don’t treat it seriously, it might show that the ideas you want to convey might not be too important to you. </p>

<p>It came to the ultimate question–knowing that I only have a finite amount of time to work on writing, did I want to work on writing uninspired sales-y blog posts that I never enjoyed writing, or did I want to work on writing thought-provoking essays that I can proudly show to an employer or a friend? </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, I was representing myself with my words. These half-assed blog posts were nothing that I would email to someone I’d just met and say, “look what I just wrote!” And that’s when I realized–I am what I write.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve held on to that creed. I’m a writer–I need to take pride in my craft. A piano player will never play a song mediocrely at a recital. As writers, everything we publish publicly is our recital. The world is free to view our work. And if that is the case, then we must show that we take our craft seriously. </p>

<p>Of course, nothing can ever be perfect, but we write to express ideas to share with the world. Ideas are meant to be imperfect. The perfect idea always begins with an imperfect idea that is fleshed out. Once upon a time, it seemed insane to even think that Wal-Mart could ever by contested in retail. Which is why Amazon did not start as an online retail store–it started as a simple online bookstore. That’s not extremely revolutionary, but it was a start. That idea eventually evolved into what is now present-day Amazon.com–retail giant that is putting Wal-Mart on its toes. </p>

<p>So that is where my first important truth comes from. I am what I write–I want to be known as a good writer rather than a good salesperson. Everything I write is a tiny snippet of the inner workings of my brain. If I can’t be proud of showing that tiny snippet of myself, I may as well not show it at all. </p>

<p>Although I’d love to expand on all three truths, allow me to dive into the first one: “You are what you write.” </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s strange to think of myself as an authority figure. I view myself as a normal person going about every day life one day at a time.</p>

<p>However, as I pointed out before, I write to manifest my ideas into the real world. They may be ideas of philosophy or ideas of fictitious worlds. The ideas may mean nothing to the rest of the world, but to me, my ideas ARE my world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Asking someone like me why I write is akin to asking someone why they drive. </p>

<p>Most people drive to go from point A to point B. There is something that is waiting for them at point B that warrants leaving point A. </p>

<p>Similarly, writing is my vehicle for reaching a new state of consciousness. Every word that I write is a step to reinvention. Reinvention for what, though? And what exactly is my point B? </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Who am I? Well, in the scheme of things, I’m a nobody. Probably not going to go down in history for anything worthwhile.</p>

<p>And I’m perfectly fine with that.</p>

<p>99% (that’s a low estimate) of all people in the world are nobodies; people who, a century after their death, will be lost in the myriad of databases. People whose entire life’s work will be meaningless and not have contributed anything to the society of the future. Nobodies who strive daily to accumulate things that won’t even last for fifty years.</p>

<p>Despite that depressing thought, being a “nobody” is beautiful. Being able to attribute meaning to a seemingly meaningless existence is simply incredible. For the billions and billions of nobodies who exist, and have existed, in this world, what makes life worth living? Why do we wake up every day, knowing that it won’t matter in a hundred years? Why do we bother going through the monotony of daily life considering that our days are not even a blip on the radar of the wheel of time?</p>

<p>Of course. We all have tried. And we all know that habit formation/change is incredibly difficult.
