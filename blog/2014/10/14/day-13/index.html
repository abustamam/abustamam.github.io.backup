<p>Subject: Do’s and Don’t’s of visiting my cubicle</p>

<p>Dear John, </p>

<p>Next time you come to my cubicle to tell me your latest exploit of a drunk girl, please do at least one (but preferably all) of the following things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a breath mint. Seriously, those peppermints are not on my desk for nothing.</li>
  <li>Wear deodorant. I would let you use mine but I have a feeling that the amount you need is more than the amount my stick provides. </li>
  <li>Whisper. I know you’re excited but you really don’t need to yell at the top of your lungs that the girl couldn’t even say her own name.</li>
  <li>Check if I’m there. It’s embarrassing to have my cube-mate tell me that you wanted to see me so you could help get me laid. </li>
  <li>Get my name right. It’s Rick, not Mick. </li>
</ol>

<p>While you’re at it, please do <strong>not</strong> do the following things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Invite me to a party. I don’t want “summa dat.”</li>
  <li>Take my pens. My pens mysteriously disappear after you come to my cubicle. I’m not saying it’s you, but no one else ever visits my desk. </li>
  <li>Spin my chair around. Especially when I’m sitting in it. </li>
  <li>Drink. C’mon, we’re at work, not the pub.</li>
  <li>Hit on my cube-mate. Seriously, she hates that.</li>
  <li>Talk to my cube-mate. Really, she hates you. </li>
  <li>Talk at all. Why can’t you get the picture that I don’t want to hear your stories? </li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, come to think of it, please stop visiting me at all. I don’t like you. I don’t know why you think I like you. I don’t know why you ever thought I liked you. I think you’re a repulsive alcoholic womanizer, and I would rather not be associated with you. I asked my cube-mate out once, and she said that she doesn’t want to associate with anyone who thinks you’re cool. The problem is that I don’t think you’re cool, and it would really help if you stopped visiting me so that I don’t have to be associated with you. </p>

<p>If you want an ear to talk off, go talk to Steve. He’s always sleeping in his cubicle anyway, so you may as well wake him up with your loud voice. </p>

<p>Sincerely, 
RICK (not Mick)</p>

<h2 id="note-to-my-loved-one-the-day-after-a-difficult-and-lingering-conflict">Note to my loved one, the day after a difficult and lingering conflict</h2>

<p>Hey honey,</p>

<p>Listen, I’m really sorry about yesterday.</p>

<p>I was out of line. I shouldn’t have said those things. I was angry, but that does not give me the right to do what I did and say what I said.</p>

<p>I’m really lucky to have you. I really am. I know that I should communicate that more often to you, but sometimes we get bogged down in the mundane happenings of everyday life that it slips my mind to tell you. </p>

<p>So I’m telling you now, honey. I love you with all my heart and I hope that going forward, we can let our undying love come first, and not our egos or petty squabbles.</p>

<p>To make up for everything, look in the driveway :)</p>
