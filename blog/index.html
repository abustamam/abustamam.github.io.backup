  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been going through <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a> and after finishing the front-end “ziplines” (which require a writeup of their own, eventually) I’m finally getting set for the fullstack “basejumps.”</p>

<p>However, on their <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-get-set-for-basejumps">“Get Set” module</a>, I ran into some problems with Cloud9 (primarily the memory issue), so I decided to figure out how to do some of these things on my local machine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="i-dont-know-if-the-following-story-is-true-but-i-like-the-moral">I don’t know if the following story is true, but I like the moral.</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Written by someone being trained by Bruce Lee:
“Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. We’d run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-tow minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a-half minutes per mile].
So this morning he said to me “We’re going to go five.”
I said, “Bruce, I can’t go five. I’m a helluva lot older than you are, and I can’t do five.”
He said, “When we get to three, we’ll shift gears and it’s only two more and you’ll do it.”
I said “Okay, hell, I’ll go for it.”
So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and I’m okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out.
I’m tired, my heart’s pounding, I can’t go any more and so I say to him, “Bruce if I run any more,” — and we’re still running — “if I run any more I’m liable to have a heart attack and die.”
He said, “Then die.” It made me so mad that I went the full five miles.
Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it.
I said, you know, “Why did you say that?”
He said, “Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it’ll spread over into the rest of your life. It’ll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes I kill things for sport. A few weeks ago, I noticed a few black widows lurking around my house. I took it upon myself to rid my house of their presence.</p>

<p>I went around the house, looking for their thick webs, the yellow bulb of their egg sacs, anything that indicated their presence. And, with my trusty brick, I would smash any and all of their nests.</p>

<p>So far, me and that brick have killed over ten black widows, and countless more egg sacs.</p>

<p>I get a bit of a kick from killing black widows. They creep me out immensely, and I get so happy knowing that I am decreasing the risk of being injected by their venom.</p>

<p>In fact, I hate them so much that we hired an exterminator to rid their presence. He sprayed poison all over our yard to make sure they all die, and never come back.</p>

<p>If there were only one black widow left in the world, you can be sure I will hunt down that last black widow to ensure they cease to exist from my realm of existence.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Am I so different than Walter Palmer? A man, simply carrying out a pastime of his, who has been absolutely crucified by the public?</p>

<p>When it comes to pests around our houses, we are extremely inhumane. I routinely replace fly and moth traps in my house, never thinking twice that anything that gets caught in the sticky residue literally writhes around until it starves to death.</p>

<p>You should see the last moth-trap I replaced. It was literally covered in moths. Hundreds of moths that I sent to certain death by starving them.</p>

<p>Why is killing a bug and killing a lion different? Is it because the lion is so beautiful?</p>

<p>Many spiders can spin absolutely beautiful webs. I sometimes find myself staring at their webs, admiring the intricacies; how a little pest with no sentience was literally wired to produce a beautiful home for itself.</p>

<p>Some spiders themselves can be pretty beautiful too, in their own, creepy way.</p>

<p>That doesn’t stop me from killing them on the spot.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Is it because the lion was named?</p>

<p>Last year, a spider moved with my family from one house to another. When I found it housed in my room, I named it Greg and let it live undisturbed, as long as he stayed in his corner.</p>

<p>One time, he disappeared. I wondered where he went.</p>

<p>A few days later, he came back. I assumed he went on vacation, and traveled to tell his friends of his exciting adventures.</p>

<p>A few days after that, he met his demise under the paws of my cat.</p>

<p>How many named spiders have I killed unknowingly? Probably not many, since I doubt many people are weird enough to name their pests.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I think it’s a statement on our fundamental humanity; not the fact that we can kill things we view as pests without batting an eye, but the fact that we feel like we can pass judgment on a man who killed one animal as seamlessly as we kill our pests.</p>

<p>Was what he did abhorrent? Given the circumstances, yes. The lion was on a protected reserve, and he was tagged. But what if Walter didn’t know? Supposedly, he was simply doing what the guy who sold him the hunting license told him to do. It’s not up to us to figure out the truth. The Zimbabwe government is supposedly taking care of it.</p>

<p>But what if he really didn’t know? What if those people who wrote graffiti on his business, those people who threatened him with bodily harm, those people who said extremely nasty and vulgar things to him (anonymously), found out <em>after</em> they carried out their supposed judgment, that he was innocent after all? That this was all just a simple misunderstanding?</p>

<p>Will a “sorry, mate” bring his dental practice back? Will it heal the wounds caused?</p>

<p>Why do we act so incongruent with ourselves when we assume the guise of an anonymous commenter?</p>

<p>Or is it that when we’re anonymous, we are our true selves, and we simply wear a mask whenever our identity is tied to our actions?</p>

<p>This is something to think about. Whether or not you agree with Walter Palmer’s actions (I certainly don’t), I hope you are able to set aside your emotions and see that the absolute outrage against Walter Palmer is a bit uncalled for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello! I finally graduated from my Frontend Nanodegree program on Udacity. Here is a recap of my previous posts:</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2014/10/31/reflection-on-nanodegree-pt-1/">First reflection</a></p>

<p><a href="/2014/12/17/re-making-the-frogger-game/">Second reflection (Bugger)</a></p>

<p><a href="/2015/01/20/optimizing-a-portfolio/">Third reflection (Optimization project)</a></p>

<p><a href="/2015/02/08/javascript-design-patterns-reflections/">Fourth reflection (Cat Clicker)</a></p>

<p>This is my final reflection. </p>

<h2 id="the-final-project">The final project</h2>

<p>My final project was a <a href="/Neighborhood-Map">Neighborhood Map</a> which is an interactive map that shows Groupons near your area.</p>

<p>It was interesting and fun to make, and of course very challenging. I’d love to hear feedback, however! </p>

<p>Here’s what I learned while working through my final project.</p>

<h3 id="knockout-js-is-not-very-extensible">Knockout JS is not very extensible</h3>

<p>I like Knockout, but it isn’t very powerful. There’s no clear “model” in the MV* architecture, so you’re kinda left up a creek without a paddle. </p>

<p>However, I did like the fact that bindings worked “automatically!” But I think Angular.js also has a similar feature, and is also a bit more robust. </p>

<p>Also, the docs suck. Like, really suck. I had no idea there was something called <code>arrayForEach</code> because it’s nowhere to be found. I had to find it online, and it wasn’t even on the KnockoutJs website. (pro-tip: adding a search functionality to your docs is invaluable).</p>

<p>All-in-all, I would have enjoyed making the project more if it were with, say Angular, but the project spec required Knockout. </p>

<p>I would have liked to have used Django, but this is the “Front-End” Nanodegree, not Full-Stack. </p>

<h3 id="google-maps-api-is-crunk">Google Maps API is crunk</h3>

<p>Interestingly enough, I (again) got most of my GMAPs info from none other than Stack Overflow. When I wanted to ensure my map was dynamically resizing, it wasn’t on GMAPs, it was Stack Overflow. </p>

<p>I feel like they should have had more examples of using their API, because the list of commands and options that they made available weren’t very helpful. It’s nice to know they “existed”, but it would have also have been nice to know how they worked. </p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-when-the-docs-suck">What to do when the docs suck</h3>

<p>Two things. You can experiement (nothing’s stopping you from making a new project and testing it out in a sandbox environment) or you can just ask Stack Overflow. </p>

<p>I would recommend testing things yourself first, so that way when you do run into a problem on you can isolate the issue and concisely share what you’ve tried on Stack Overflow without the whole she-bang of your entire project. </p>

<h3 id="dont-procrastinate">Don’t procrastinate</h3>

<p>I have development hours for myself, and I would always find ways to “do” stuff during my development hours that weren’t really productive. That is to say that although I would be working on my project, I’d be doing something menial rather than solving an actual problem. In this way, I would still be working, but not really advancing my problem.</p>

<p>For example, I spent a long time on my sidebar because I didn’t want to add markers. I was putting off the adding of markers because it felt like a big task, so I did smaller tasks like edit the CSS for my sidebar. </p>

<p>The goal of making an app is to JFS (stands for Just F&amp;$%ing Ship) so not everything needs to be completely optimized. Get a MVP (minimum viable product) going and you can tweak as you go after that. Otherwise, you’re wasting time and putting off the inevitable. </p>

<h2 id="overall-review-of-the-nanodegree">Overall review of the Nanodegree</h2>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed my experience with the Nanodegree, and I would definitely consider doing the Full Stack ND, and perhaps even Data Science. For right now, I’m going to focus on a couple of other courses that I’ve purchased but put off, so check back soon for those! </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Trending today seems to be problem number 24 of a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/15/living/feat-cheryl-birthday-math-problem-goes-viral/">Singaporean Math Olympiad test</a>. Let’s not get bogged down why suddenly the Internet is clamouring over solving a seemingly impossible math problem, but since everyone wants to figure out the answer, let’s go through how to get it.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I have not consulted any outside sources to verify my answer, but I’m fairly certain my logic is sound.</p>
