<div class="entry-content"><p>It’s strange to think of myself as an authority figure. I view myself as a normal person going about every day life one day at a time.</p>

<p>However, as I pointed out before, I write to manifest my ideas into the real world. They may be ideas of philosophy or ideas of fictitious worlds. The ideas may mean nothing to the rest of the world, but to me, my ideas ARE my world.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>So what am I an authority on? Well, on the non-fiction side, I can tell vivid stories that my words can bring to life. I told my coworkers the (true) story of me letting a spider live in my room. Such a simple story and yet, my coworkers still mention that story every so often.</p>

<p>I can uncover wisdom and life lessons from the most mundane concepts. Going back to my spider story, the moral there was that nothing is so insignificant in the world that is not worth mentioning. I learned that there are no boring “things,” just boring ideas.</p>

<p>And that is what I’m an authority on–creating magnificent ideas from seemingly “boring” things.</p>

<p>On the nonfiction side, my goal is to inspire, to encourage, to motivate, to teach. I believe that writing must make the world a better place, even if it is a world within the confines of one’s intellect. My ideal reader will ask of himself, “How is it that such a simple story can contain such profound meaning?”</p>

<p>If my ideal reader is to ask that, then my ideal goal is to keep my stories simple, but to twist them in a way that provides meaning beyond what most people expect from a simple story.</p>

<p>Fictionally speaking, I take my knack of real-life story telling and create an imaginary world and bring it to life. Even if the story is as far-fetched as wizards battling knights, I want it to be believable within the confines of the story. The world will have its own laws, similar to how our world has the laws of conservation of mass and the law of gravity. The story must adhere to these basic laws, but after the world is established, the characters in the world will shape the story.</p>

<p>I’m a fan of psychological thrillers. I never like cheap scares like pop-ups or screams; I prefer the type of thriller that keeps you on edge because the protagonist(s) and the antagonist(s) are trying to keep one step ahead of one another.</p>

<p>My ideal audience will be people who enjoy movies such as the Bourne series, and shows like Breaking Bad. Perhaps my writing will never reach the caliber of these wonderful films/shows, but I want to bend the mind of the reader. Just when the reader thinks one thing will happen, another thing happens and turns the story upside down.
In my fiction, I want to explore themes such as love and betrayal, but not so cliche as the femme fatale who ends up being the arch nemesis of the protagonist. In the real world, things are rarely binary–real people have real emotions that leave them conflicted and confused. What does a character do when faced with a moral dilemma where both options will hurt someone he loves?</p>

<p>I want to be an authority on the human psyche–explore why someone would cheat on their beloved, or murder their best friend. In addition, the writing will reflect the state of mind of the character in the spotlight, so readers can join the character in his metamorphosis.</p>

<p>To summarize, I want to be an authority on two things– manifesting profound lessons from mundane ideas, and creating characters that transform into completely different people. Through writing, I hope to grow into this authority and speak to the hearts of my readers.</p>
