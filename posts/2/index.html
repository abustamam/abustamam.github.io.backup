  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Day 14: For your prompt today, I am literally taking a page from someone else’s book. (See description for details.)</strong></p>

<p><em>The following, from John Gardner’s The Art of Fiction, page 37, is one of the most famous and enduring writing prompts out there:  Describe a barn as seen by a man whose son has just been killed in a war. Do not mention the son, or war, or death. Do not mention the man who does the seeing. …The result should be a powerful and disturbing image, a faithful description of some apparently real barn but one from which the reader gets a sense of the father’s emotion; though exactly what that emotion is he may not be able to pin down. …No amount of intellectual study can determine for the writer what details to include. If the description is to be effective, he must choose his boards, straw, pigeon manure, and ropes, the rhythms of his sentences, his angle of vision, by feeling and intuition. And one of the things he will discover, inevitably, is that the images of death and loss that come to him are not necessarily those we might expect.</em></p>

<p>The sun is setting, the sky is darkening, and the door of the derelict barn finally comes off its hinges and lays flat on the dirt.</p>

<p>The barn stands there, as it has for decades, but on this day, it looms over the farm like a fortress towering over its kingdom, casting a shadow that plunges even the most fertilized grass into darkness. </p>

<p>On the outside of the barn’s wall, a spider is enjoying its dinner, not caring about the decrepit nature of its home.</p>

<p>The spider finishes its meal and spins a web to lower itself to one of the many rotting bales of hay littering the barn. The spider crawls across the moldy grains of straw, disappearing into the pile.</p>

<hr />

<p>A fly flaps its wings through the crisp dusk air, stopping momentarily on a block of wood that used to be a part of a fence, before landing on an old wooden board, barely attached to the barn by a rusty iron nail. The board had once been bright red, but time has washed away all evidence of its color. </p>

<p>The fly buzzes into the barn and lands on a pile of manure. The fly pauses here for an undetermined amount of time, enjoying its new environment. Several other flies join it after a while, buzzing around noisily. The fly zooms away from the manure and stumbles upon the decaying carcass of a cow that was once named Bessie. The milk that this cow had once provided was the source of much happiness. But now, the cow has succumbed to the flow of nature, yet she is still able to provide nourishment for the flies that have found her rotting flesh. </p>

<p>After satiating his hunger, the fly returns to the outside of the barn, zigging left, zagging right. Suddenly, the fly is caught on something, unable to move. It attempts to fly away, but its body is stuck to the silky, yet sticky, web. The fly tries again, flapping its wings, thrashing against the web, but it is unable to escape.</p>

<p>The web begins to bounce as its creator approaches the fly. The fly buzzes one final time in an attempt to escape, before it is fully enveloped in the soft threads of silk.</p>

<hr />

<p>The spider has returned to its nest on the barn’s wall only to find its next meal thrashing about, attempting to escape. It spins its silk around the fly until it is fully wrapped in a cocoon. Having secured its next meal, the spider lowers itself down to the ground, scurrying across the barren dirt. Though it is dark, the spider is still able to perceive a change in the light, but is unable to conceive of any final thoughts as the boot is raised above the spider and crashes down to the ground. </p>

<h2 id="sarcastic-email-to-a-colleague">Sarcastic email to a colleague</h2>

<p>Subject: Do’s and Don’t’s of visiting my cubicle</p>

<p>Dear John, </p>

<p>Next time you come to my cubicle to tell me your latest exploit of a drunk girl, please do at least one (but preferably all) of the following things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a breath mint. Seriously, those peppermints are not on my desk for nothing.</li>
  <li>Wear deodorant. I would let you use mine but I have a feeling that the amount you need is more than the amount my stick provides. </li>
  <li>Whisper. I know you’re excited but you really don’t need to yell at the top of your lungs that the girl couldn’t even say her own name.</li>
  <li>Check if I’m there. It’s embarrassing to have my cube-mate tell me that you wanted to see me so you could help get me laid. </li>
  <li>Get my name right. It’s Rick, not Mick. </li>
</ol>

<p>While you’re at it, please do <strong>not</strong> do the following things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Invite me to a party. I don’t want “summa dat.”</li>
  <li>Take my pens. My pens mysteriously disappear after you come to my cubicle. I’m not saying it’s you, but no one else ever visits my desk. </li>
  <li>Spin my chair around. Especially when I’m sitting in it. </li>
  <li>Drink. C’mon, we’re at work, not the pub.</li>
  <li>Hit on my cube-mate. Seriously, she hates that.</li>
  <li>Talk to my cube-mate. Really, she hates you. </li>
  <li>Talk at all. Why can’t you get the picture that I don’t want to hear your stories? </li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, come to think of it, please stop visiting me at all. I don’t like you. I don’t know why you think I like you. I don’t know why you ever thought I liked you. I think you’re a repulsive alcoholic womanizer, and I would rather not be associated with you. I asked my cube-mate out once, and she said that she doesn’t want to associate with anyone who thinks you’re cool. The problem is that I don’t think you’re cool, and it would really help if you stopped visiting me so that I don’t have to be associated with you. </p>

<p>If you want an ear to talk off, go talk to Steve. He’s always sleeping in his cubicle anyway, so you may as well wake him up with your loud voice. </p>

<p>Sincerely, 
RICK (not Mick)</p>

<h2 id="note-to-my-loved-one-the-day-after-a-difficult-and-lingering-conflict">Note to my loved one, the day after a difficult and lingering conflict</h2>

<p>Hey honey,</p>

<p>Listen, I’m really sorry about yesterday.</p>

<p>I was out of line. I shouldn’t have said those things. I was angry, but that does not give me the right to do what I did and say what I said.</p>

<p>I’m really lucky to have you. I really am. I know that I should communicate that more often to you, but sometimes we get bogged down in the mundane happenings of everyday life that it slips my mind to tell you. </p>

<p>So I’m telling you now, honey. I love you with all my heart and I hope that going forward, we can let our undying love come first, and not our egos or petty squabbles.</p>

<p>To make up for everything, look in the driveway :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Day 12: Describe the lives of your audience by describing the lives of singular individuals.</em></p>

<p><em>Describe the lives of your audience by describing the lives of singular individuals. Describe concerns, desires, suffering. What do they (not they, but he, she) do, say, think, and feel? Make them (not them, but him, her) as human as possible.</em></p>

<h2 id="note">Note:</h2>
<p>I took the last statement of making the character as human as possible a bit too far, and evolved from describing the life of an individual into a short story. However, by the time I realized I was off-prompt, I’d gone too far and decided to finish the story. The take-home point is that my audience is full of people like David, though perhaps not with his exact story :) </p>

<p>His friends call him David, though his real name is Davoud. He’s nothing spectacular. Just an ordinary engineer. </p>

<p>Every day he pores over diagrams, charts, and graphs in an attempt to perfect the design of the device his company makes. </p>

<p>Although David loves his work, or at least, that’s what he tells himself and his wife, he feels unfulfilled. He really loves the idea of creating something that will help individual lives, rather than pushing the frontier of technology for the sake of pushing it. </p>

<p>David is swamped with work and other worries, so he has no time to cultivate his passion for helping people. His skill in hardware engineering is a difficult one to bring to consumers on a direct basis, so he is lost. </p>

<p>While having coffee with his best friend Shawn, David confides in him and asks what he should do. Shawn tells David that he should be grateful for having a job in the first place, let alone having one that pays as much as he makes, and that it’s a waste to throw his hardware engineering work to scratch an itch that might not even pan out. He concludes by saying that you can either do fulfilling work, or pay the rent.</p>

<p>David tells Shawn a white lie and says that he agrees completely. The truth is, David only half-agrees. David certainly is lucky to have such a prestigious career, and the money that comes alongside, but he feels that someone as intelligent as him should be making a real difference in perhaps not the world, but definitely in individual people’s lives. He thinks of Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, and Jeff Bezos; people who changed the world with their revolutionary ideas.</p>

<p>However, his thoughts are brought back down to earth by Shawn, and his dreams are shattered as he realizes that perhaps he will never be as great as those figures. </p>

<p>David takes solace in the fact that there’s no point in trying, and shelves his dream in the corner of his mind, the corner where sentimental, yet fundamentally useless, things are stored. Things to be looked at, but not to be used. </p>

<p>One day, while eating breakfast at a cafe, David notices something not particularly peculiar, but definitely concerning. An old man is hobbling from patron to patron, unsuccessfully asking for some spare change. The patrons, each with a 7-dollar breakfast and a 3-dollar coffee in front of them, dressed to the nines, are suddenly broke, unable to give this man the smallest fraction of their wealth. </p>

<p>Dejected, the old man begins sifting through a trash can. David instantly sees himself in the old man–both have a hunger that needs to be satiated, and when that hunger can’t be satiated after numerous attempts, is instead fulfilled by taking scraps of other people. </p>

<p>David decides he needs to put a stop to this–both the old man digging through the garbage, and the method of satiating his hunger. </p>

<p>Though he has no cash on-hand, David invites the old man to dine with him, buying a sandwich and a drink for him. </p>

<p>The old man graciously accepts, and the two chat over breakfast burritos and coffee. </p>

<p>David asks the old man why he doesn’t have any money to buy food. The old man replies that he once worked in finance, and had a huge house, with a beautiful wife, and a few kids. When the economy collapsed, he lost his job, and had trouble finding another one. He had to downsize the house and take a job at Starbucks, and it was then he was met with the news that his wife wanted to divorce him and take the kids. The man was ridden with the undue stress of divorce, losing his kids, and struggling to pay the bills, as well as paying back the debt he’d taken on while he was rich, and upon a visit to the doctor, was told that he had stomach cancer. He was able to barely pay for his medical bills, but the subsequent surgeries rendered him unfit to work, and as such, he was unable to pay the rent of his house, and was left on the streets. Since then, he has been wandering the streets, begging for scraps. </p>

<p>The old man looks at David with a look of sincerity, yet urgency, and says, “Never settle for scraps in your life. Do things that make you grow, that make you happy. Doing things for the money will only attract to your life people who want money.”</p>

<p>The old man thanks David for the meal, and hobbles off into the crowded streets of the city.</p>

<p>David ponders the old man’s story, and realizes that their stories are not much different. The old man was capable of so much, but focused only on making money rather than creating value. And now he is not capable of much, and has to settle for scraps. David is capable of doing more, but settles on unfulfilling work–scraps, in the context of his life. Furthermore, David seems to only attract to his life people who are also unfulfilled in life, such as Shawn. </p>

<p>David surmises that the ten dollars spent on the old man’s meal would be a drop in the bucket compared to the value of the old man’s advice, but only if he took action on it. David makes the decision to begin associating himself with people doing fulfilling work that still pays the bills. </p>

<p>He applies for jobs at companies that has a mission that he truly believes in. He begins a new job that is similar to the job he was working previously, except now he knows that his work is going to mean something in the world. They even let him make some key decisions because of his expertise. David had never been happier in his life. </p>

<p>David was once a hardware engineer, living an unfulfilled, meaningless life. Now, David is still a hardware engineer, doing the same work, but feels much more fulfilled. All it took was a change in what his work meant to him changed his entire outlook on life. </p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2014-10-11T22:54:36-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 11<sup>th</sup>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Day 11: After looking back and considering the blog post or article, add your own voice. Write your own response.</em></p>

<p>I recently read <a href="https://medium.com/@andrewjiang/unintentionally-in-yc-9dd0ccbaeb44">this article</a> about a guy named Andrew who left finance with no direction, and a couple months later found himself in Y Combinator, possibly the most prestigious start-up accelerator in the US. I was really inspired by the story because as an entrepreneur, it is my dream for me to get accepted into YC or a similar accelerator. The story really solidified the fact that great things can happen if you simply <strong>start</strong>.</p>

<p>When I read that Andrew had no plan when he moved to the Bay Area, it really made me wonder–is a plan really necessary to succeed in life? There’s the common saying, “failing to plan is planning to fail.” But how much of that is true? These days we hear a lot of stories of people who “accidentally” make it big. </p>

<p>After reading this article, as well as other similar articles, it made me think that perhaps a definite plan is not always necessary. Of course, there are consequences to not having a plan, which is why some sort of fallback is necessary. For example, Andrew lived (presumably) off of savings (and ramen) and worked part-time so his burn rate would be reduced. Obviously, he wouldn’t have been able to live forever under those circumstances, but it bought him time to figure out what he wanted to do. </p>

<p>In that time, instead of “figuring out” what he wanted to do, he went ahead and built stuff. He knew he wanted to build meaningful apps, so he went ahead and did that. And that leads to the first lesson we can derive from his story: </p>

<p><strong>Find your itch and scratch it with passion.</strong></p>

<p>In the digital age we live in, anything you create can be instantly viewed by someone at the other side of the globe. And you never know who that person knows. </p>

<p>When Andrew started losing his mojo with solo projects, he joined a hackathon. There, his passions were rekindled and he got inspired to play in a bigger sandbox. In addition, he met some people that would be integral to the start-up he’d be forming. And that gives us the second lesson we can derive from his story:</p>

<p><strong>Get around like-minded people</strong></p>

<p>A common saying is, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” I believe it’s kind of true, but also kind of backwards. “It’s not who you know, it’s who knows you.” By getting around like-minded people, you can rekindle your motivation but also get more eyes on your number one product: you (and your skills). It’s a great and fun way to make friends too. </p>

<p>After Andrew got a few important eyes on his work, he and his business partner Paul formulated what would become Bayes Impact (their non-profit). Their little side project quickly escalated into something that consumed their entire lives, and the rest, as we know, it history. Perhaps the most underscored, but also the most important, lesson we can get, is this one:</p>

<p><strong>Know when to stop trying new things and hone in</strong></p>

<p>Andrew went from trying something new every two weeks to finally focusing on a single passion project. He knew somewhere, perhaps in his heart, that this was THE project. Maybe it was the vision that he and his team had, maybe it was the fact that he enjoyed it so much that he dedicated so much of himself to it, but regardless, he knew it was time to stop trying new things and start focusing his energies on Bayes Impact. </p>

<p>Now his team is in YC, and there’s nothing that can stop them from changing the world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Day 10: Return to the blog post or article you reviewed yesterday. (See description for details.)</em></p>

<p><em>Return to the blog post or article you reviewed yesterday. Today, imitate its genre and purpose, but write about a topic or tell a story of your choosing. That is, write about what you want, but write in the language of the blog post or article you reviewed yesterday; make use of its logic and conventions and symbols; and find a way to offer a surprise!</em></p>

<h2 id="important-note">Important note:</h2>

<p>The following article is fictional. It was written for the sole purpose of imitating the writing style of <a href="https://medium.com/@andrewjiang/unintentionally-in-yc-9dd0ccbaeb44">this article</a>. My name is not Chelsea, I did not drop out of Yale, nor do I work for Google (yet!), nor did I ever create an app called EncouragUr (though it’s on my list!).</p>

<h1 id="unintentionally-hired-by-google">Unintentionally Hired by Google</h1>
<p>Leaving an Ivy League school only to be hired by the world’s most sought-after tech giant
———————————-</p>

<p>In May of 2013, I determined that the walls of my dorm room at Yale were limiting my creativity. I visited admissions to let them know not to re-enroll me for Fall semester, and at that point I was no longer a student. I sold off my belongings and booked a one-way flight to SFO, eager to start fresh. No job, no plan, not even a place to live (I would be what I called an “AirBnB couch surfer” for the first two months).</p>

<p>As of this writing, it’s exactly one year later, and ten months since I started employment at Google. How did this happen?</p>

<p>Here’s the entire unintentional story. </p>

<h2 id="moving-fast-and-breaking-things">Moving Fast and Breaking Things</h2>

<p>During the first two months living in the Bay Area, I slept in many different beds thanks to AirBnB, and survived off of dollar Taco Tuesdays and Top Ramen. I worked part-time at a grocery store to reduce the burn rate of my savings and get discounts on groceries. At nights would crank out prototypes, fleshing out new ideas every few weeks. </p>

<p>I made some garbage apps, and I made some priceless gems. Some of them still have potential, but I simply didn’t have the drive to pursue them further, which leads me to the first lesson I learned: <strong>You need to care deeply about the problem you’re solving.</strong></p>

<h2 id="lets-chat">“Let’s chat.”</h2>

<p>I began to feel a bit lonely and unfulfilled, so I decided to attend my first hackathon. I met with some great people at this hackathon, but the resulting product is the direct cause of my employment at Google. </p>

<p>The mission of this particular hackathon was to build something that one person can use to help another person in their lives. Our team built “EncouragUr,” a way for people to send anonymous messages/postcards to their friends who may be feeling a bit unmotivated. </p>

<p>I shared the hack with my friends on Facebook and got a lot of positive feedback. One person in particular was my friend Justine, who worked at Google, left a simple comment: “Let’s chat.”</p>

<p>I messaged her and we had dinner together, and she told me she’d shared the app with her hiring manager, saying that my passion for unleashing the greatness within people would be a great asset to Google. I was taken aback–I had no intentions of working for Google. I just wanted to freelance my way to paying bills and being debt-free. I thanked her and continued my merry ways of project-to-project, couch-to-couch living, anxiously awaiting that email. </p>

<h2 id="hi-chelsea-we-heard-about-your-work-and-would-like-to-meet-with-you">“Hi Chelsea. We heard about your work and would like to meet with you.”</h2>

<p>I told one of my hosts about my situation and he told me that he’d heard that Google’s hiring process was notoriously difficult. That made me even more anxious, so all my projects came to a dead stop as I began brushing up on my algorithm and data structure skills. </p>

<p>A week after that dinner, while I was aimlessly browsing Reddit to wind down, I got the email. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From: Ryan (at Google)
To: Chelsea </p>

  <p>Hi Chelsea. We heard about your work and would like to meet with you.</p>

  <p>Ryan
Hiring Manager at Google</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could hardly believe my eyes. I quickly replied and was soon on the phone with Ryan, who scheduled me for an interview on the Tuesday of the next week.</p>

<p>That weekend was manic. I did my best to solve problems on TopCoder, CodeAbbey, anything that could help me with my algorithmic thinking. I polished my interviewing skills and filled out my notebook with questions I thought I should ask at the interview. By the time Monday rolled around, I was breathing coffee, but I knew Dijkstra’s algorithm better than the back of my hand. </p>

<p>I decided to take Monday to relax, so I could be well-rested for my big interview on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The day of the interview will always be forged in my memory. I nervously sat in the waiting room while another candidate was being interviewed. When they called me into the room, I was so nervous I tripped on the carpet while walking into the room. Classy. </p>

<p>Sitting in front of me was my interviewer: David Zen. He cut to the chase and had me solve a problem on a whiteboard. He asked me about my experience. My passions, my life goals. There was nary a moment of silence as our interview convened. </p>

<p>After perhaps the fastest half-hour of my life, I shook his hand, thanked him, and was on my way out. While on the BART back to SF, I called my boyfriend, my mom, my dad, my brother; anyone who I thought would care about this big interview. I was so excited and anxious and nervous that I didn’t even notice the incoming call from the 408 area code. I finally noticed it when I got off the BART in SoMa, San Francisco, and promptly called back. </p>

<p><strong>It was Ryan, with an invitation to begin employment at Google the following week.</strong></p>

<p>Salary and relocation would be negotiated in the following days, but I’d done it. Two months after I’d dropped out of school and flew to California with nothing but the clothes in my bag and my MacBook, I’d secured employment at Google. For those of you who want a career shift or just a new life, why wait? <strong>Start now, you never know who will notice.</strong> Or, in Cal Newport’s words: “Be so good they can’t ignore you.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Day 9: Write a review—a review for writers—of your favorite recent blog post or article. (See description for details.)</em></p>

<p><em>Write a review—a review for writers—of your favorite recent blog post or article. What ideas draw you into the article? But, more than the ideas, what writing choices did the author make that made it so good? What tools of representation—words, jokes, descriptions, metaphors, hyperbole, informal voice, call to action, etc.—did the author use that you also might use someday?</em></p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@andrewjiang/unintentionally-in-yc-9dd0ccbaeb44">The article</a></p>

<p>I picked this article because I wish to start a start-up one day, and the fact that someone could “unintentionally” get into YC really piqued my interest. It’s also, overall, an inspirational story with a simple call-to-action: start! </p>

<p>The first thing that stands out about the article would be the title. </p>

<p>“Unintentionally in YC: Leaving finance and landing in the world’s most prestigious accelerator without meaning to”</p>

<p>Anyone who’s ever dreamed of starting a start-up knows the two letters YC, and it’s always their goal to get accepted into YC. The target audience is already suckered in–unintentionally getting into YC is the pipe dream, and so the title provides intrigue. </p>

<p>Andrew starts the article with his before: “I’d crash on friends’ couches for the better part of two months” and then the after: “we’re working with the best civic and nonprofit organizations in the world, including the Gates Foundation, Kipp, and the White House.”</p>

<p>There is a stark contrast before his before and after, and everyone loves reading about the “rags to riches” hero story (even if the hero did not necessarily begin in rags nor end in riches). This sets the context for the story to follow, and invites the readers to join him in his journey. </p>

<p>Andrew begins his story with his little pet projects. It’s a logical place to start a story about start-ups. I would venture to say that the primary project of a start-up is rarely the first project of the founders. </p>

<p>When transitioning to his start into team-prototyping, there’s a full-size picture that has 5 words: “Dude, we need to talk.” Very entrancing and makes the reader wonder, “about what?” </p>

<p>The next “chapter” of his story is when he gets an offer from YC. This is signified by another full-size picture with the text, ““Hi Paul, Andrew, and Eric — This is not spam””</p>

<p>Given that the reader already knows that Andrew has gotten into YC, the reader automatically assumes that the quote came from someone from YC, reaching out. </p>

<p>The rest of the story details the team’s interview process and getting excited to begin a new chapter of their lives. </p>

<p>I really enjoyed the story primarily because it spoke to my heart, as an entrepreneur at heart. </p>

<p>Though the style in which the article is written is nothing special (except of course for the breaks in text via pictures), I just enjoyed the encouraging story behind the text, as well as the simple call to action at the end: “Just start.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Day 8: Write a thank-you letter to the owner of a business. (See description for further context.)</em></p>

<p><em>Write a thank-you letter to the owner of a business who anticipated, met, and exceeded your needs. Tell your story. Describe your experience candidly, and your delight, and your surprise. After you’ve finished a draft of the letter, go back and make it beautiful and clear. Do your best to make your prose (its precision, its melody) really carry your gratitude, by expressing your story concretely and your feelings truly.</em></p>

<p>[It’s been a while since I’ve had the pleasure of being pleasantly surprised by the quality of service of a business owner. As such, I am going to create a story of such an experience and tell it through this fictitious letter]</p>

<p>Dear Jacques, </p>

<p>Last week, my boyfriend and I had the pleasure of dining at Caffe Rolle for our anniversary, during what seemed to be a peak time–Friday night dinner. I am writing this letter to express my utmost appreciation for the service we received that night. </p>

<p>When we arrived, there was already a line of people waiting to be seated. I had heard excellent things about this restaurant and needed to experience it for myself, even if I had to wait a half hour to be seated. </p>

<p>My wait was alleviated by the fact that there was a TV in the waiting area, as well as a water cooler. There were also pamphlets that were designed to teach French basics. Going through those pamphlets and quizzing and being quizzed by my boyfriend was a lot of fun, and definitely a productive way to pass the time. </p>

<p>The 30 minutes was over before we knew it, and we were seated at a table with one long unlit candle in the middle, though no other tables had a candle. After we were seated, however, we were greeted by none other than you yourself, the owner of the fine establishment. You came by to offer us a complimentary bottle of wine and a plate of escargot as appetizers, and to wish us a happy anniversary.</p>

<p>I followed your steps as you departed our table, and you disappeared into the kitchen, only to emerge with another bottle and a plate of escargot, ready to serve another table. I looked around and saw that the restaurant was extremely busy, but the fact that you personally came by to greet us was extremely touching, and I assumed it was commonplace since you were off to serve another table. It was at that point that I knew that I was in for quite the experience. It was also at this point that I had begun to suspect that my boyfriend had perhaps planned this when he made his reservation, but I made no mention of it. </p>

<p>We browsed through the menu while chewing our snails. Though the menu was all in French, the pamphlets in the waiting area helped with understanding it. I settled on the coq au vin, and my boyfriend chose the pot-au-feu. The waitress assured us that we made excellent choices and was off to deliver our order. </p>

<p>While waiting, we continued learning French through the pamphlets and before we knew it, our food was served. I could tell that there was a professionally trained chef in the kitchen because the presentation of the food was more perfect than what you’d usually see on TV. The waitress offered to take a picture of us before we started on our food, and we took her up on the offer. </p>

<p>As we ate our food, our waitress continually refilled our water cups and ensured that everything was fine for us. Not once were we given the bill before we were ready. I overheard a group who had received the wrong order and it sounded like they were given free dessert for their troubles. </p>

<p>We were given take-home boxes and our food was professionally packed, rather than leaving us to our own devices, and then we were offered the dessert menu. You can never go wrong with creme brûlée so we ordered one for each of us. The dessert was delectable, and was definitely the right size. </p>

<p>My boyfriend and I decided on a hefty 30% tip for the amazing service we were offered, and even then I still feel like we got the better end of the deal. As we got ready to leave, you approached us from the kitchen yet again, with a bouquet of red roses in your hands. By the way they were cut, I could tell that they were not the kind you get at the gas station. I graciously accepted your gift, and we pushed past the line of people at the door to leave. </p>

<p>That must have been the single-most pleasant dining experience I have ever had. Even if my boyfriend were somehow involved in organizing this, we were both pleasantly surprised by the quality of service. The way you treat each customer as an individual, rather than just another customer, is likely why you are the top-rated restaurant on Yelp for a 30 mile radius. </p>

<p>Keep doing what you’re doing. Thank you again. </p>

<p>Regards,
Monica Trebal</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The truth: “Experiment with everything.” </p>

<p>Many restaurants have dozens upon dozens of types of delicious foods. Many “regulars” of these restaurants order the “usual” because they are afraid of trying something new. I challenge you to be the person who tries a new dish, just to try it–because hey, you may find yourself a new “usual!”</p>

<p>Just like patrons of a restaurant, writers too have a “usual.” Of course, there is nothing wrong with having a “usual” genre–“Harry Potter” is proof that 7 books based on the same character can be pretty successful. If it ain’t broke, why fix it? But maybe it is broke, and you may not realize it. I never realized that I needed new glasses until I did get new glasses–then I realized how blind I had been, and how much clearer the world was supposed to be. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“There is no such thing as a stupid idea.” What a truth this is! </p>

<p>Every day, aspiring writers give up their goal to become published because they feel like their ideas are stupid. </p>

<p>Here are a few “stupid” ideas that the authors decided to write about anyway. Let’s see how they turned out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A story about a hot vampire, a hot werewolf, and a girl who doesn’t know which hot guy to go with (Twilight, best-selling book of 2008)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fan fiction extension of the above story, except with less vampires and werewolves and more whips and chains and pain (50 Shades of Gray, sold over 100 million copies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this 10 year old boy discovers he is a wizard, he manages to save the school (and sometimes the world) from the darkest evil ever known to the world, conveniently just before the end of the school year! (Harry Potter, upwards of 400 million copies sold)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Armed with a bow and arrow and two hot guys, this young girl leads the rebellion against the nation that nuked the hell out of the last people who tried to rebel (Hunger Games, 65 million copies sold)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A dude is hired to change a CEO’s mind by hacking into his dreams, but upon failing, the same CEO hires the same dude to change a different CEO’s son’s mind by hacking into his dreams’ dreams (Inception, $800 million gross revenue)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A half-paralyzed guy on an alien planet manages to accomplish insane feats of finesse and agility in 3 months, simply by controlling an alien body. Oh and 3D! (Avatar, first film to gross over $2 billion)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A boat full of hot people sinks (Titanic, $1.85 billion, first movie to surpass $1 billion revenue)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, anything can be twisted to seem like a stupid idea. Since we are our own worst critics, of course we are going to see our ideas as stupid. Moreover, we’re going to compare our ideas with the great ideas we see on Hollywood and on the New York Times best selling books list. </p>

<p>The fact is, everything begins as a stupid idea.  You can flesh that little idea out into something truly meaningful. </p>

<p>The ideas you think of are your ideas. Granted, there are some bad ideas–curling your hair while showering is certainly not a good idea. However, if you can give meaning to an idea, there’s no possible way it could be stupid. For myself, redemption is an important theme. Therefore, anything that involves redemption, no matter how ridiculous it may seem at first, can be meaningful to me. A story could be about two cats feuding, then one redeeming himself by performing a heroic act–perhaps with the right twist, that idea could become something amazing. </p>

<p>Some people may think that “stupid ideas” get in the way of their writing and therefore they stop.</p>

<p>I contend that if you are one of those people, it is you who is in the way of your writing. Get out of your own way and allow the ideas to flow. I hope you never get in the way between a “bad idea” and your writing. You owe it to yourself to acknowledge those ideas. </p>

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“You are what you write.”</p>

<p>There’s an interesting story behind these five words. I once aspired to become a famous Internet blogger, and thus I blogged every day for 30 days to set a habit. I followed the rule, “quantity vs quality.” </p>

<p>Sometimes, quantity trumps quality, especially when it comes to Internet marketing. A blog posted only in one place has only one chance to be viewed. However, syndicating multiple blog posts to multiple websites increases the chances of your name getting out there. For many Internet marketers, writing blogs is simply a means to the end–which is to make sales. Quality wasn’t necessarily important as long as it wasn’t <em>terrible</em>. </p>

<p>That being said, it was extremely difficult for me to blog every day. I never knew what to write about. I wasn’t <em>that</em> interested in my niche. So I sacrificed quality for quantity. </p>

<p>After two weeks of grueling pain through writing uninspired pieces, I reread a few of my blog posts (many of which were written with very little sleep) and thought to myself, “If I didn’t know Rasheed, and I read this blog post, would I think he’s a cool guy?”</p>

<p>The answer was “no.” My blog posts were written with an ulterior motive–to sell. Many were written for the sole purpose of having something to attach my signature to, which of course always included an affiliate link.</p>

<p>Now, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with writing to sell. Products must be sold, and writers are required in order to create sales copy. Sales pages are extremely profitable, even if they are terrible. But there’s a difference between writing to sell and writing to share ideas. When you’re writing to sell, you often put aside the eloquence you would otherwise have if you were writing merely to express ideas. After all, eloquence doesn’t necessarily solve people’s problems–potential customers want to know what the product can do for them. Eloquence rarely has a place in a sales letter, and that’s fine. Right tool for the right job. But if you’re writing to express ideas, then the quality of your writing needs to reflect the ideas you wish to convey. If you don’t treat it seriously, it might show that the ideas you want to convey might not be too important to you. </p>

<p>It came to the ultimate question–knowing that I only have a finite amount of time to work on writing, did I want to work on writing uninspired sales-y blog posts that I never enjoyed writing, or did I want to work on writing thought-provoking essays that I can proudly show to an employer or a friend? </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, I was representing myself with my words. These half-assed blog posts were nothing that I would email to someone I’d just met and say, “look what I just wrote!” And that’s when I realized–I am what I write.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve held on to that creed. I’m a writer–I need to take pride in my craft. A piano player will never play a song mediocrely at a recital. As writers, everything we publish publicly is our recital. The world is free to view our work. And if that is the case, then we must show that we take our craft seriously. </p>

<p>Of course, nothing can ever be perfect, but we write to express ideas to share with the world. Ideas are meant to be imperfect. The perfect idea always begins with an imperfect idea that is fleshed out. Once upon a time, it seemed insane to even think that Wal-Mart could ever by contested in retail. Which is why Amazon did not start as an online retail store–it started as a simple online bookstore. That’s not extremely revolutionary, but it was a start. That idea eventually evolved into what is now present-day Amazon.com–retail giant that is putting Wal-Mart on its toes. </p>

<p>So that is where my first important truth comes from. I am what I write–I want to be known as a good writer rather than a good salesperson. Everything I write is a tiny snippet of the inner workings of my brain. If I can’t be proud of showing that tiny snippet of myself, I may as well not show it at all. </p>
