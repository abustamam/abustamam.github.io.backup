  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="six-weeks-later">Six weeks later</h1>

<p>I’m back, and I’ve finally finished my game project, using HTML5 Canvas and JS. You can view the finished project <a href="abustamam.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game">here</a>. </p>

<p>The courses used were <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud292-nd">HTML5 Canvas</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015-nd">Object-oriented Javascript</a>.</p>

<p>I learned a lot while working through this project. Not only about programming, but also about motivation and getting things done. </p>

<h2 id="when-youre-stuck">When you’re stuck…</h2>

<p>I learned that when you’re stuck, just go with your “gut feeling” and see if it works. If it doesn’t work, check the errors, and see if you can fix what you broke. </p>

<p>Always always <em>always</em> work one change at a time if you’re “stuck,” unless of course you’re confident what you’re doing is going to work. Here’s an example…</p>

<p>At one point, I decided I wanted to add a character selection screen. Up until this point, the canvas was only drawing the main game. In order to add a character selection screen, I needed to add a new “screen.” To this effect, I decided to add a “game state” to the game, so that way the engine could track the state of the game and render appropriate content for its state. </p>

<p>Once I did that, I worked the start screen piece by piece. I started by drawing one character, then the Selector, and then I added more characters. Then I added the logic to the Selector class, and ensured that the Selector responded in the way I wanted it to. Then I ensured the Selector was passing in the chosen character data to the main game, so that it could render the correct character. </p>

<p>** Bug: Notice that when you choose one of the heroines on the right side, they start on the right side instead of in the middle. I am working on a fix for this. </p>

<p>I like to imagine development like Lego. You have a plethora of commands and methods at your disposal, you need to use your imagination and iteratively build upwards, until you get what you need. </p>

<h2 id="designing-your-code">Designing your code</h2>

<p>When you use function declarations…</p>

<p>function () {}</p>

<p>vs </p>

<p>var fn = function () {}</p>

<p>…Javascript does something known as “hoisting.” Function declarations are loaded <em>first</em>, so the order doesn’t really matter. </p>

<p>However, they <em>do</em> matter to you. When you’re looking for something that broke, or want to tweak something, you’ll want to find it quickly. So it’s important to have everything organized in a logical sense, using comments when necessary. As tempted as I was to haphazardly place prototypical functions wherever I wanted to, I made sure that the prototypical functions were neatly organized beneath their respective classes. Perhaps it was my OCD, but it made it immensely easy for me to find everything. </p>

<p>It also makes it easy for you to keep code in your head. </p>

<h2 id="mustering-motivation">Mustering motivation</h2>

<p>I’ve had the opportunity to work a lot of hours during this project. There were also a lot of family visits, and I managed to get sick twice. That made my motivation to code shot. </p>

<p>How did I get past humps? </p>

<p>First, I made a clean workstation. A workstation that is organized allows for an organized mind and thought process. I moved my desk around so it makes me feel like I’m in an office, so I’m tempted to work as if I were in an office. </p>

<p>Second, I made a list (mental or otherwise) of things I wanted to accomplish. What was my task for today? Was it to add collision detection? Was it to add winning conditions? Was it to add a start/game-over screen? I’d choose one task and hack at it. </p>

<p>Third, when I felt like I had momentum (or “flow”), I’d stop. This is effective because it allows for your brain to relax (e.g. not think about the problem at hand). The next day, I’d be motivated to pick back up where I started and continue my momentum.</p>

<p>Contrast this with following through with momentum. If the first task to do the next session is difficult, it’ll be hard to motivate yourself to do it. So if you make finishing the task easy and push it to the start of the next session, you’ll continue your momentum and be able to drive through the difficult task more easily. </p>

<p>And finally, no workstation is complete without a kitten on your lap.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>My next project is to learn website optimization. I’ll of course post my results of the next project when I’m done. </p>

<p>Til next time! </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="udacity-nanodegree-overview">Udacity Nanodegree overview</h2>

<p>I’ve been plowing through <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001">Udacity’s Front-End Nanodegree program</a>. It’s a pilot program, designed to learn front-end web development from the ground up.</p>

<p>I started the day I was allowed to, which was about two weeks ago. </p>

<p>So far, I’ve completed the <a href="/Udacity-Portfolio">Mockup to Website</a>, and <a href="/frontend-nanodegree-resume">Interactive Resume</a>. </p>

<p>The courses are decent; I enjoy the byte-sized lectures interspersed with quizzes. The courses don’t go too deep, but that’s what the projects are for.</p>

<p>What you really get for the Nanodegree tuition is access to mentors and of course the certification. Since all of the coursework required to complete the projects is technically free on Udacity (which is really awesome of them!), we’re really just paying for the service of mentorship.</p>

<p>What I’ve come to realize is that many people lack mentors in life. They follow a pre-determined career path that includes university and internship, and they have a college advisor, but many times the advisor has not gone through the same path. Also, the advisor is not heavily emphasized, which I feel is a big mistake. </p>

<p>The best thing a student can have is a mentor, not only for the knowledge, but also the connections.</p>

<p>Given all of that, is Udacity worth the $200 a month? Well, I’m scheduled for my first 1-on-1 mentorship session next week, so only time will tell. </p>

<p>As I go through the program, I will continue posting updates and reflections about the program. </p>

<h2 id="the-actual-coursework">The actual coursework</h2>

<h3 id="project-1-mockup-to-website">Project 1: Mockup to Website</h3>

<p>The first course I took in the Nanodegree program was <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud304">Intro to HTML and CSS</a>. This was billed to be “Not your average HTML and CSS course,” which I found to be interesting. I’ve taken countless HTML and CSS courses online, and most of them tend to be pretty much the same. They’re all good, but at the end, I couldn’t do much by myself. </p>

<p>By the end of the Udacity course, I was able to go from PDF mockup to website from scratch. It’s all an iterative process, which no other HTML course had ever told me. </p>

<p>Most other courses focused on syntax, which of course is important, but always left out design. Rather than having us create the site, they tell us what the numbers are, and we simply translate that to syntax. </p>

<p>Udacity ensured that we could do everything on our own, which is the definition of mastery. </p>

<p>So was it your average HTML and CSS course? No, definitely not. And since the course is free (remember, you pay for mentorship, not knowledge), I definitely recommend anyone new to web development to take this course.</p>

<p>As an aside, I really love the informal nature of the classes. I hate classes that take themselves too seriously. Learning shouldn’t be boring. Why shouldn’t the instructor throw random round objects at another instructor? </p>

<p>Granted, learning should be taken seriously, but it doesn’t need to be serious to be taken seriously. Having fun is important too, and nothing says we can’t have both!</p>

<h3 id="mini-project-learn-github">Mini-project: Learn Github</h3>

<p>What I like about the Nanodegree program so far is that it focuses on career development. So rather than just learning random skills, the skills you learn are actually organized in a way that increases job-readiness. And it’s no secret that version control is pretty much a requirement for any software-related job. </p>

<p>I’ve taken a couple of Github crash courses, and some other courses I’ve taken included at least one or two lessons on “gitting” started with Git, but I still always found myself completely lost when using version control. Not only that, but I learned syntax and commands, but not why I should do what. I didn’t know the difference between committing and pushing, nor when to commit. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud775">How to Use Git and Github</a> is a wonderful course that starts from ground up. Rather than immediately pushing students into the Github environment, it introduces Git as a software, and the first part of the course is dedicated to explaining what Git is, and how to use it. </p>

<p>I really liked that part because then I realized how many more applications Git could have other than software developemnt. For example, you could use it to keep track of important files locally, or you could “version control” a novel or something similar. </p>

<p>After that, the course delves into your very first Github repository, and then we get into collaboration with Github.</p>

<p>What made the course especially unique was the fact that we were required to do “reflections.” These were basically little thoughts that made us think about what we were actually learning, and why we were learning it, which I found incredibly effective. </p>

<p>You can read my reflections <a href="https://github.com/abustamam/reflections">here</a>. </p>

<p>All in all, I learned a lot from the course, and I recommend it to anyone who is new to Git(Hub).</p>

<h3 id="project-2-interactive-resume">Project 2: Interactive Resume</h3>

<p>The natural follow-up to learning HTML/CSS is JavaScript. HTML is how things are laid on the page, CSS is how things are shown on the page, and JavaScript makes all of that non-static. </p>

<p>I wouldn’t consider JavaScript a “beginner” language, since most “beginner” languages have the concept of classes, which JavaScript doesn’t technically have. Python seems to be the go-to beginner language, which is probably why it’s recommended to take the Python courses before moving on with the JavaScript course. </p>

<p>Regardless, the next project is the Interactive Resume. When I saw the project title “Interactive Resume,” I read it to be a resume that the user could interact with. Instead, it’s a normal resume whose content comes from JSON, which is fine, it just doesn’t seem very interactive. </p>

<p>All that aside, the course for this is <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud804">JavaScript Basics</a>. </p>

<p>Out of the few courses I’ve completed at Udacity, JS Basics is probably the worst (even though it’s pretty good). All of the courses I’ve taken with Udacity have been pretty good thus far, but there has to be one worst, and JS Basics takes the cake. </p>

<p>Why? The course is confusing. We learn the project goal. And we begin constructing it. Then for no well-defined reason, we’re told to erase all the lines of code we wrote and start fresh.</p>

<p>I’m all for starting fresh, but then it goes from a blank slate to a half-full resume from one video to the next, and following along with the video would not result in the “this is how your site should look now” shown. I had to do a lot of things myself to make it look how it was supposed to, but nowhere that was mentioned. </p>

<p>Other than that caveat, the course is pretty good. It teaches the syntax and the basics of JSON, which is something that very few JS courses ever teach.</p>

<p>Though JS Basics is a good course, I would recommend Codecademy over Udacity for learning JavaScript Basics. Only after that would I take this course. </p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>

<p>That about wraps up my first couple weeks in the Nanodegree program. I’ll be back with another update once I finish my game project!</p>

Maybe go somewhere you like to go (a coffee shop, a park, the beach, the lot behind 7-11) to describe it.

<h2 id="important-note">Important note</h2>

<p><em>The following piece is fictional. Please don’t send me condolence letters. Thanks :)</em> </p>

<p>“Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me.” Such is the mantra of kids who get bullied and need a way to combat the bullies. But the broken bones I had were much easier to bear than the words I heard on the evening of my 21st birthday.</p>

<p>He was driving me to what I had figured to be my surprise birthday party, having a good laugh. Then when we crossed Main Street, the world turned upside down. </p>

<p>I remember that moment clearly. One moment we’re laughing; the next moment, we’re spinning. Everything happened as if time had slowed down. The airbags popped out and Gerry’s head bounced off the bag before hitting the window, and my own head hit the bag and lurched sideways. The entire world spun around me as the other car pushed ours. </p>

<p>My neck hurt, but I felt fine. I looked at the shattered window, and then at Gerry, whose head was resting against the window. After struggling with my airbag, I managed to shake his shoulder and shout his name. He did not respond. I shook his shoudler again, shouting more loudly. He did not respond. I fumbled with my seatbelt then burst out of the door, stumbling onto the pavement. I looked at one bystander and yelled at him to call 911. He retrieved his phone and dialed immediately. </p>

<p>I limped to the car that hit us. Through the broken window I could see the driver, who did not seem to be awake. I tried to open the door from the outside but it was locked. I reached into the car and shook the man’s shoulder to see if he would wake up. Shouting accomplished nothing. </p>

<p>Another bystander approached me, asking me if I was okay. I told her I felt fine but that my boyfriend was in the car, locked in because the other car had hit his door. She put her arm around me and tried to comfort me. I coudn’t pay attention to what she was saying because I was in such a daze. I couldn’t believe this was happening. </p>

<p>When the ambulance finally arrived, I was in hysterics. I told them that my boyfriend was trapped in the car, unconscious. The medics told me to calm down and that they needed to check me for wounds. It took two men to hoist me onto the stretcher and restrain me. I demanded that they tend to my boyfriend first, but they insisted on taking care of me. </p>

<p>They wheeled me into the ambulance and I can’t remember what happened after they put the respirator on me. </p>

<hr />

<p>After an hour in the hospital, I was told that as a result of the crash, I had broken two ribs and required 9 stitches on my face from the shards of glass slashing me. I didn’t care about any of that. I asked the doctors and nurses what happened to Gerry. They all hesitated and said they didn’t know, but that they would get someone who did know to tell me. </p>

<p>Finally, one doctor sat at the foot of my bed, looked at me, and sighed. Then he uttered three words that made my broken bones seem painless. </p>

<p>“Gerry is dead.”</p>

<p>Sadness overcame me and my eyes welled up with tears. I told myself it wasn’t possible. That Gerry was in the next room, recovering just like I was. I told myself that we would emerge from the hospital together, broken, but together. I told myself that I would be able to come home and see his smiling face, and feel his warm embrace. </p>

<p>But the void in my heart told me that none of that was true. He was not recovering. We would not emerge from the hospital together. And he would never again be able to wrap me in his arms. I knew the truth. Gerry was dead. </p>

<p>I thought it was my fault. If I hadn’t chosen to have my surprise birthday party on that day, none of this would have happened. If I had chosen to drive, perhaps I could have seen the car coming towards us and stop. If I had decided to have a small, intimate celebration with Gerry, then we wouldn’t have to be on the road at all. </p>

<p>Despite all the self-blame, I knew that there’s nothing I could do then to bring him back. Yet I wished I was able to say goodbye properly. I wished I could have savored that last hug for just five more seconds. I wished I didn’t say those mean things to him the previous week. So many regrets, but nothing I could do to come to terms with them. </p>

<p>I always think about what life could be if the crash had never happened. I think about the kids we could have had. The house we could have lived in. The life we would be living together. But then those three words echo in my head, “Gerry is dead.” My broken bones healed eventually, but nothing will ever be able to mend the wound those three words caused.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Day 15: Given your aims for your writing, look at the world around you: What images appear? (See description.)</strong></p>

<p><em>Given your aims for your writing, look at the world around you, at the landscape: What images appear? What likenesses do you see? How, for you, is the world like itself? When you describe it, what comparisons do you make? What verbs do you use? And when you talk about your business, do you talk about the “bottom line”? Are you in a “rat race,” a world of “dog eat dog,”? Or do you talk about “service” and, as Seth Godin famously makes use of, are you gathering a “tribe”? Place yourself, your writing aims, in a world of images, of analogies. For you, for what you want out of writing, write about how the world is like itself.</em></p>

<p>“The world is your playground.”</p>

<p>These five words succinctly summarize my aims for writing. </p>

<p>I love writing for the same reasons people enjoy series such as Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, or movies such as Inception, or books such as Harry Potter. People who enjoy different forms of fiction just enjoy being taken out of their current world and thrust into the world of the author’s choosing. For a moment, they can forget their problems and be sucked into someone else’s reality. </p>

<p>Now, I enjoy movies and TV shows as much as anyone else. However, I elect to be thrust into a world of my own choosing. A world where I attempt to see the world through someone else’s eyes, even if that someone else doesn’t even exist. By writing, I can remove myself, even if but for a moment, from the harsh realities of my day-to-day life and find myself living the harsh realities of a creation of my own imagination. </p>

<p>Putting it that way, it may sound like I’m crazy, but I liken it more to a state of mind than actual believing. By changing the way I think, I change the way I write, and therefore, change the way the text communicates with the reader. </p>

<p>The aims of my writing are mainly to explore the human psyche, as well as explore the reasons people do things. In addition, I would like to encourage the readers to question reality–who do we actually know? Most people in our lives wear very elaborate, elegant masks, that cover up who they really are. The successful man next door with the “perfect marriage” may be knees-deep in debt and having an affair. The man who drives an old used car and lives in a small house on the other side of town might be debt-free and have an impressive investment portfolio. There is always more to a person than he or she letse on. Just because something seems to be true doesn’t necessarily make it true. </p>

<p>To be cliche, never judge a book by its cover. This goes both ways–the book with the best cover may not necessarily be the best book ever, nor may the book with the ugly cover be the absolute worst book. However, despite how cliche that may be, people are always surprised when a person reveals a side that they’ve never shown before. People are rarely binary–we are complex creatures with many emotions and countless ways to justify our actions. </p>

<p>The world is my playground. Now, the world I want to play in may not be the world we live in–in that case, I’ll create my own world to play in. I write so I can have others to play in that playground with. And hopefully, we emerge from that playground as changed people. People who see the world in a different way. People who become more introspective and more appreciative of the world around them. </p>

<p>So, come join me in my playground. I might even push you on the swings :)</p>
